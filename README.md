# What is this?
This is a sample project using Jetpack Compose for dynamic theming, that can be implemented, for example, by receiving a color from an API and saving it into a shared preference.

This is based on the article written by Adam Bennett that can be found at: https://adambennett.dev/2020/11/server-driven-theming-in-jetpack-compose/ \
His original implementation can also be found at his repo: https://github.com/ditn/dynamic-design-system

This is probably a bad idea for many cases, but can be quite useful if, for example, you're trying to implement something like Telegram's themes, where the user can choose every color.
