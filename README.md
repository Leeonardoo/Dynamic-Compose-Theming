# What is this?
This is a sample project using Jetpack Compose for dynamic theming, that can be implemented, for example, by receiving a color from an API and saving it into a shared preference.

This is based on the article that can be found at: https://adambennett.dev/2020/11/server-driven-theming-in-jetpack-compose/

This is probably a bad idea for many cases, but can be useful, for example, if you're trying to implement something like Telegram's themes, where the user can choose every color.
